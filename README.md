#  Event Listing Platform
 A website where students and faculty can find all the exciting events happening on campus in one place. Our project creates exactly that. It's a user-friendly website where you can see all the upcoming events, like workshops, seminars, and social gatherings, happening at your school. You can even add your own events to the list. We're making it easy for everyone to stay in the loop and be a part of campus life. You can filter events, RSVP to them, and even update or cancel your own event listings. Our goal is to bring the campus community together and make sure no one misses out on the fun!
